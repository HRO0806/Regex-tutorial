# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

This is a introduction to Regex tutorial. It teaches you the basics by finding a hex value. I break down how each part of the regex by explaining what it is, how it is used, and how I use it in the example.

This tutorial should act as a nice introduction to Regex. It uses a fairly simple Regex (it finds a hex-value) to acomplish this. I hope you enjoy my introduction tutorial.

You can find the tutorial in the develop folder in the tutorial.md file.
